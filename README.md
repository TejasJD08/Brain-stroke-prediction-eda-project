# END-TO-END BRAIN STROKE PREDICTION PROJECT


This notebook looks into various Python based ML and data science libraries in an attempt to build a ML model with Exploratory Data Analysis which is capable of predicting whether patient will have stroke or not based on given attributes.

We're going to take following approach :

1.Problem definition/statement

2.Importing Necessary libraries & tools

3.Data loading and cleaning

4.Exploratory Data Analysis

5.Feature engineering

6.building ml model with accuracy score

7.Insights
